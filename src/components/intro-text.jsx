										I took my first pre-tertiary sales role in Lagos,  Nigeria,<br /> 15+ years ago and progressed to selling a wide range of offerings—business services, <br /> everyday consumer products, million-dollar real estate,<br /> and more recently, technology solutions. <br />
                    My experience brings together marketing strategy,<br /> business development execution, and venture-building know-how. <br /> This combination allows me to shape markets, convert opportunities, <br /> and support new business lines from concept to scale—ensuring <br /> that strategy translates into real, measurable outcomes.
